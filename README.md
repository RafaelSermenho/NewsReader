# News Reader Android App

This news reader app made with *Kotlin* has the following features:

 1. Main Screen: List all sources for every category that is available;
 2. Article Screen: Shows all articles from a selected source.

## Architecture
This app uses *MVVM* (**M**odel-**V**iew-**V**iew**M**odel) to avoid memory leaks and crashes due to activitie's lifecycle issues. Another advantage is to have isolated responsabilities for every component

## Detail every module

## DI
I used KOIN

## What could be improved?
cache, single source of truth, possibility to change language, select multiple sources and search for keyword.
